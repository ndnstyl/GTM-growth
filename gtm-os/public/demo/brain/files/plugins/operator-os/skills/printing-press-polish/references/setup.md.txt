After setup, capture `PRINTING_PRESS_BIN=<abs-path>` and use that absolute path for every `cli-printing-press ...` invocation in this skill. If setup emitted `[go-toolchain-old]` or `[low-disk]`, surface the advisory to the user and continue unless setup also emitted `[setup-error]`. `[go-toolchain-old]` means later Go commands may download the required toolchain or fail when downloads are blocked; `[low-disk]` means this run may need several GiB for generated files, Go build cache, module downloads, or repository clones.

Check binary version compatibility by reading the `min-binary-version` field from this skill's YAML frontmatter, running `"$PRINTING_PRESS_BIN" version --json`, and parsing the version from the output. Compare it to `min-binary-version` using semver rules. If the installed binary is older than the minimum, stop immediately and tell the user: "cli-printing-press binary vX.Y.Z is older than the minimum required vA.B.C. Run `go install github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/v4/cmd/cli-printing-press@latest` to update."

### Public-library hint

If the user's request includes phrasing like "polish notion **in the
public library**", "polish **from the public library**", or "polish the
published cal-com", and the named CLI is **not** in
`$PRESS_LIBRARY/<slug>/`, they're asking to polish a CLI that lives
upstream but not locally. Polish runs against the internal library, so
the right move is to import first.

Suggest: `/printing-press-import <slug>` to bring it in, then re-run
polish. Don't try to polish a CLI that isn't in the internal library.

If the named CLI **is** already in `$PRESS_LIBRARY/<slug>/`, the
"public library" phrasing is informational, just proceed with polish
and let the divergence check (`references/divergence-check.md`) handle any drift.
